In a way, I passed the afternoons. Thunk to the bottom of a. Flowery box with an open ceiling, an open roof looking up to the sky. Which is that particular color of blue that. I've only ever seen an Africa. Not sure whether it's because of the. Green. And the red of the roads. The walls, the boxer. Made of bougainvillea. Four or five or 6 shades of. Red and pink and purple and white. I am visited by Emerald green geckos and tiny hunting lizards. All manner of insects. 1000 different bugs across these pages. Every evening when I leave them out. An entomologist. Dream the garden is tended by the guards. Jean or Jean, or Jean or Jean. That clipped the grass close and area the size of. 3 Bed Sheets laid side by side. I have planted chilies. Hundreds of chilies. My only contribution? Selfish. I don't eat the bananas at the back. The guards help themselves. When I am done with the. My laundry, the guards. Hang their clothes when I'm away at work, I wonder. Do they get about naked when I'm not here, only slipping into there? Tattered. Trousers and T-shirts when they hear me ring the bell. When I go to. Do my laundry next all of the clothes tags are broken.
