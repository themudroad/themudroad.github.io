In this way I passed the afternoons, sunk to the bottom of a flowery box with an open ceiling looking up to the sky which was a particular colour of blue that I've only ever seen in Africa. Not sure whether it's because of the green and the red of the roads. The walls of bougainvillea four or five or 6 shades of red and pink and purple and white. 

I am visited by emerald green geckos and tiny hunting lizards. All manner of insects. A thousand different bugs drew these lines across this page in evening when I left them out. I am a an entomologist/translator/amanuensis.
