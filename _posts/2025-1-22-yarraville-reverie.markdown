# Commutation
*“… for a man to measure his happiness, he must go to the closet & lay out his ties  end to end. <br> 
This is the exact distance he stands from happiness” –Michael Leunig*

A champion’s breakfast of metaphor,  <br>
spotted yellow tie, tooth-paste, mouth-wash <br>
and I head out to catch the 8.01 <br>
bound for Spencer St station. <br>
 <br>
The ticket machine already vandalised, <br>
I have time to watch students spit at one another<br>
Across the platforms, in clear violation<br>
of the silence agreed upon by the adults congealed<br>
 <br>
in the shadow of Yarraville station.  <br>
The Werribee Express shoulders past empty <br>
and I’m naïve enough to ask, "Why doesn’t it stop here?" <br>
They back away from me as if I have <br>
 <br>
an accent, or poetry on my breath.  <br>
Finally some reprobate on a skateboard  <br>
slips under a Williamstown train,  <br>
and relief warms the platform like justice. <br>

# Fare Evasion
 <br>
I love a morning like this: the light  <br>
in a vise of black cloud & quicksilver  <br>
city skyline. So thick & slow you could  <br>
run a finger-tip through it like icing  <br>
 <br>
on a birthday-cake. Not hurrying, though <br>
it’s true I’m late & there is work to do-- <br>
for someone else & a little money,  <br>
But it’s Friday morning & it doesn’t  <br>
 <br>
matter. I’ve got my headphones on & my <br>
feet up on the seats. Only the clatter  <br>
of train wheel & rail gets through. I’m reading <br>
poems & rocking. I haven’t bought a ticket <br>
 <br>
& yet  I could be headed anywhere. <br>
