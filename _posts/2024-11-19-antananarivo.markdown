In this way I passed the afternoons, sunk to the bottom of a flowery box with an open ceiling looking up to the sky which was a particular colour of blue that I've only ever seen in Africa. Not sure whether it's because of the green and the red of the roads or a glitch of memory. The walls of bougainvillea four or five or 6 shades of red and pink and purple and white.

I am visited by emerald green geckos and tiny hunting lizards. All manner of insects. A thousand different bugs drew these lines across this page in evening when I left them out. I am a an entomologist/translator/amanuensis.
