A man
Dream the garden is tended by the guards. Jean or Jean, or Jean or Jean. That clipped the grass close and area the size of. 3 Bed Sheets laid side by side. I have planted chilies. Hundreds of chilies. My only contribution? Selfish. I don't eat the bananas at the back. The guards help themselves. When I am done with the. My laundry, the guards. Hang their clothes when I'm away at work, I wonder. Do they get about naked when I'm not here, only slipping into there? Tattered. Trousers and T-shirts when they hear me ring the bell. When I go to. Do my laundry next all of the clothes tags are broken.
