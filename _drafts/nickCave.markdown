My god I have loved the music of Nick Cave over the years, and Bob Dylan well...

"Cave said he believes the world has grown “thoroughly disenchanted, and its feverish obsession with politics and its leaders had thrown up so many palisades that had prevented us from experiencing the presence of anything remotely like the spirit, the sacred, or the transcendent – that holy place where joy resides”."

Put alongside this: “what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age. Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest.”

Ben Lee on Nick Cave
"To me, he is giving the greatest acting performance of a songwriter, rather than being the greatest songwriter....It’s a very earnest role. He’s playing the literary singer-songwriter. People are really attached to this idea of authenticity. But it’s been interesting watching him as he’s been through genuine hardships and tragedies. I think, as we get more and more broken, we actually become more humble and happier as a person. That’s the impression I get [of Cave] – when I saw him live recently, he had such a gentle, generous spirit in between songs. Then he’d launch into the songs, and it was like, “Oh, the Dark Lord” – and you realise that is his chosen character."
Is easy to take this out of context, Lee said he didn't want any blowback I don't want any either; go read the interview and listen to Lee's <new> album. <i>This One’s For the Old Headz</i> I can't help but feeling I'm, one of the target audience. Then listen to Cave's Wild God, because, it's true we do deserve a little joy. As for Dylan skip the old stuff, Rough and Rowdy Ways is where it's at.

Imagine Billy Bragg sing to coal miners, 'Hey guys, what we need right now is a little joy.'
Desmond Tutu, 'When did this become all about politics?'
Woodie Guthrie
Dylan's Hard Rain, How many Roads etc
