In this way I passed the afternoons, sunk to the bottom of a flowery box with an open ceiling looking up to the sky which was a particular colour of blue that I've only ever seen in Africa. Not sure whether it's because of the green and the red of the roads or a glitch of memory. The walls of bougainvillea four or five or 6 shades of red and pink and purple and white. 

I am visited by emerald green geckos and tiny hunting lizards. All manner of insects. A thousand different bugs drew these lines across this page in evening when I left them out. I am a an entomologist/translator/amanuensis. 

Seeking to ride out the chaos of the pandemic in more familiar territory, the author and his partner secured a seat on one of the last Australian Government flights out of Mumbai, a decision that would see them separated for almost a year. Within a few months, having left the twenty-fourth floor of an apartment building in Mumbai, he passed through a half-dozen dark and empty airports to finally wash-up in a garden in Antananarivo, Madagascar. Isolating from the world, his partner and ultimately himself, he says, "I tried to make some sense of it in this collection of text based drawings/paintings. They seem to me the residue of a thirty-five year search for a place to call home, without ever really finding the right word for it."
